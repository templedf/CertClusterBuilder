Cloudera Connect Certified Technology Cluster Appliance
================================================================================
This project is an application that Cloudera technology partners can use to
easily launch a pre-configured cluster for use in certification testing.

Run `mvn clean assembly:assembly` to generate a redistributable binary archive
in `target/cert-cluster-builder-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-dist.tar.gz`.  Unpacking this
gives a `start.sh` (and a `README`) which can be used to launch the tool.

Certified Technology program, or this application, please contact
